								<h2>DIY Smart Home</h2>
							</div>

							<br>

							<p> Wanting to learn about the IOT scene, I’m attempting to build some connected devices to automate parts of my home. The first device is a connected power socket that can be controlled remotely or automatically. </p>
				      <p> First step - a switch. A 5V relay is used to control the 240V AC socket, driven by an ESP8266 12E board. The ESPs are a great little micro controller, which pack an impressive amount of power as well as reliable wifi connectivity. This is a lot more impressive when you consider their 3 USD price point, even as a dev board. </p>

							<div class="image">

							</div>

				      <p> This switch is connected to a power strip which has been modified to have the one of the power sockets run through the relay, while the other is permanently connected to provide power to the control module. </p>

							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/home_plug.jpg" alt="" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"/>
							</div>

				      <p> In this first iteration, the ESP communicates with a control site, which I can host on heroku or a local server. The site uses a simple html form to update a page ‘/relay’. The ESP the uses a http client and GET requests to view the content of /relay, and change the state of the power socket accordingly. </p>

							<pre><code>
if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) { //Check WiFi connection status
	HTTPClient http;  //Declare an object of class HTTPClient
	http.begin(<i>ControlSite</i>);  //Specify request destination
	int httpCode = http.GET();  //Send the request

	String payload;
	if (httpCode > -0) { //Check the returning code
		payload = http.getString();   //Get the request response payload
		if (payload.substring(0, 1) == "1") {
			digitalWrite(Relay1, LOW);
		}
	}
	http.end();
	}
delay(10000);    //Send a request every few seconds
							</pre></code>
							<br>
				      <p> This system works, but uses an unnecessary number of requests. A future iteration will likely be implemented using MQTT to broker commands, so communication is limited to when the state changes. </p>
