								<h2>Augmenting Time Series Models with Neural Networks</h2>
							</div>
							<br>

				      <p>This project was an experiment to determine if the universal function property of neural networks can be exploited to overcome limitations in autoregressive time series models. Specifically, it aims to allow the model to automatically adjust for non-linear trends.</p>
				      <p>The prediction of macroeconomic variables is a process essential to policy and business decision making. This has largely relied on autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models. However, these models assume a linear data generating process, an assumption that can result in the delivery of suboptimal predictions due to ‘hidden nonlinearity’. </p>
				      <p>All networks explored in this follow the following structure:</p>

				      <p>The following three networks are explored:</p>

							</div>

				      <p>Two training methods were trialed: Training method 1 simply applies gradient descent to all weights, while method 2 uses OLS to find the coefficients of the AR component, then with these values held constant the rest of the network is trained with gradient descent.</p>
				      <p>The three models are trained with each methods 1 and 2 on both observed (FRED, 2017) and generated series. The generated series are shown below and were designed to test the model's non-linear capabilities</p>

				      <p>Many hours of (CPU :( )) training later, I obtained the following results</p>

				      <p>I found that the training technique has a large impact on the performance of the model, with the models trained using gradient descent alone performing better than the models where the AR component is trained separately. This is likely due to the simultaneous optimisation of all the wights being more effective than separately optimising the AR and NN components. Secondly, model a appears to perform the best of all of the models, while the single layer model d performing poorly. This success of model a is likely due to the removal of the activation function in the final intermediate or hidden layer, which allows the network to process values beyond (0,1). Model a offers lower RMSE than an AR model of the same number of lags across all datasets tested, improving accuracy of predictions by 0.05% to 2.05%.</p>

				      <p> This model could be applied to reduce the labour required to build models where computational power is cheap and non-linear trends are probable, however, the improvements in accuracy are marginal at best. </p>
				      <p>In short, it may be better to just difference the series...</p>
